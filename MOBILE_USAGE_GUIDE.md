# StillMaster Mobile Usage Guide

## Quick Start for Mobile Users

### Opening the Sidebar
1. Tap the **☰ hamburger menu** icon in the top-left corner
2. Sidebar slides in from the left with a backdrop overlay

### Closing the Sidebar
You have **3 ways** to close the sidebar on mobile:

1. **Tap anywhere on the main content area** (easiest!)
2. **Tap the dark backdrop** behind the sidebar
3. **Tap the hamburger menu icon** again

### Automatic Sidebar Closing
The sidebar will automatically close when you:
- Navigate to a different page (tap any menu item)
- This prevents the menu from blocking your view after navigation

## Navigation Tips

### Desktop (Laptop/Computer)
- Sidebar is open by default
- You can collapse it to an icon-only view using the hamburger menu
- Main content adjusts to give you more space when collapsed

### Tablet
- Similar to desktop but with slightly smaller spacing
- Sidebar can be toggled as needed
- Better optimized for touch

### Mobile Phone
- Sidebar is hidden by default to maximize content space
- Tap hamburger to reveal full navigation menu
- Tap anywhere on content to dismiss and return to viewing
- All buttons and links are sized for easy tapping (no more fat-finger mistakes!)

## Form Entry on Mobile

### Text Inputs
- All input fields are properly sized for touch
- Font size is 16px to prevent auto-zoom on iOS
- Easy to tap, type, and move between fields

### Buttons
- All buttons are minimum 44x44 pixels (Apple/Google guidelines)
- Clear visual feedback when tapped
- Easy to hit with your thumb

### Tables
- Scroll horizontally if table is too wide for screen
- Smooth touch scrolling
- Row data remains organized and readable

## Dashboard Cards
- Stack vertically on mobile for easy scrolling
- Large, easy-to-tap cards
- Clear icons and descriptions

## Best Practices

### Portrait Mode (Recommended)
- Optimized for single-hand use
- Sidebar takes appropriate width
- Content is well-formatted

### Landscape Mode
- More horizontal space for tables and forms
- Sidebar still works as overlay
- Great for data entry

## Troubleshooting

### Sidebar won't close?
- Try tapping directly on the content area (not on the sidebar itself)
- Or tap the hamburger menu icon

### Content seems zoomed in?
- This is normal browser behavior
- Pinch to zoom out if needed
- Forms are optimized to prevent unexpected zoom

### Elements too small to tap?
- This shouldn't happen - all interactive elements are minimum 44px
- If you find something too small, please report it

## Device Support

✅ **Tested and working on:**
- iPhone (iOS Safari)

## Need Help?

The mobile interface is designed to be intuitive. The key thing to remember:

🎯 **Just tap the main content area to close the sidebar!**

This makes navigation quick and natural - open menu, select page, content appears with menu automatically closed.

Happy distilling! 🥃
